  Howdy,
  Set up git repository, and committed all changes up to this point. Put any notes about the current version, 
  and a quick line about major changes here, as well as anything that needs done (below).

  -moves toward angle of rotation now. crosshairs also fixed to correct distance.

TD:
-change Object3D to instantiate objects by-vertex, perhaps assigning shape somewhat randomly. 
//could you try this one? I'm on respawn and lazers right now. Also, would you mind putting our list of who-does-what here? thanks a bunch, Wolfgang.
